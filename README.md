# Heat Number Announcer (RotorHazard Plugin)

The plugin announces the `Event` and `Round Number` at the start of each race, giving your DVR recording an audible cue for easy identification.

> e.g.
>
> ðŸ“¢ Event RaceGOW #5, Round 22 started

This way you are able to easily find your best rounds and laps.
